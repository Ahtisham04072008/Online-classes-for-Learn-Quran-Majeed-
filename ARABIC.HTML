      <div class="box"><h3><i class="fas fa-history"></i>Tajweed’s Origins and Principles</h3><p>This body of knowledge predominantly relies on oral communication and auditory reception. Hence, the practical authority in formulating rules is the Prophet (PBUH), as Allah SWT revealed the Quran to him with Tajweed. Conversely, scholars of Quran sciences play a pivotal role in developing these laws from a scientific standpoint.</p></div>
      <div class="box"><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i><h3>Tajweed is primarily founded on four factors</h3><p>
        ⦁ Knowledge of the articulation points of letters.
<br>⦁ The ability to discern the qualities of the letters.
<br>⦁ Understanding how the rules governing letters change based on their sequence in writing.
<br>⦁ Engaging in tongue exercises and extensive repetition.
