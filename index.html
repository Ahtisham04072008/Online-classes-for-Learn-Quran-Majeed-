         Tajweed means the Arabic word for beautification. Reciting the Quran under Tajweed sets the correct way to pronounce and recite its verses. It means each letter in the Quran is read with its proper rights and qualities when someone recites. So, each Muslim should make sure to learn the Holy Quran online following the proper Tajweed rules.

    <h2>How Do Quran Classes Online Benefit Children in the USA?</h2>
    <p>
      Online learning gives you the opportunity to learn from teachers in countries like the USA, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, without being restricted to teachers close to you. Since our teachers use English, Arabic and Urdu, students who are starting to learn Tajweed or Arabic have no language barriers, even if they are not fluent in Arabic. We provide Quran recitation lessons, as well as instruction in Basic Tajweed, Arabic, Qirat, Ijazah and Quran Memorization to people of all ages. Benefits exist for learning the Quran as a child, but it’s always possible to start studying later. You don’t have to wait until you’re old to start. For many children, learning Quran from a distance is attractive since they are drawn to technology. And because online courses can be flexible, students can fit regular religious study into their daily routines.
